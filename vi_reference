vi and vim Editors Pocket Reference
Introduction
This pocket reference is a companion to Learing The vi and Vim Editors, by Arnold Robbins et al. It describes the vi com- mand line options, regular expressions and the use of the substitue (s) command, and other pertinent information for using vi.

While retaining coverage of the vi clones, nvi, elvis, and vile, this edithion offers expanded coverage of the Vim editor, which has become the de facto standard version of vi in the GNU/Linux vi for this pocket reference.
